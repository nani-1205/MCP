# cloud_webapp/requirements.txt

Flask>=2.0       # The core web framework
Flask-SocketIO>=5.0 # For WebSocket communication
python-dotenv>=0.15 # Optional: Good practice for loading environment variables like FLASK_SECRET_KEY from a .env file during development
eventlet>=0.30   # Recommended asynchronous server for Flask-SocketIO for better concurrency and WebSocket handling
gunicorn>=20.0   # Optional but recommended: Production WSGI server (often used instead of eventlet directly for deployment)

# Note: When deploying to Cloud Run or similar, you might configure gunicorn
# with eventlet workers in your Dockerfile's CMD or ENTRYPOINT.
# Example Dockerfile CMD using gunicorn with eventlet:
# CMD ["gunicorn", "--worker-class", "eventlet", "-w", "1", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "app:app"]
# The port (8080) might need to match Cloud Run's expectations.
